# Traffic volume forecasting in Minneapolis Saint Paul westbound I-94
The wrong decisions wasted billions, efforts, and
time each year, but , lately reliance on the data in decisions
become obligatory, which reduce the wrong decisions possibility,
and instead of rely on the human experience, the date became
our fascinating guide, so we tried to provide an informative and
valuable information for decision makers and decision makers
in the transport and road sector, this project help to predict
the traffic volume in the future based on historical time-series
data, detect the abnormal behaviour, two approaches were used
here for prediction Regression using Xgboost and Time-Series
prediction using ARIMA & SARIMAX & Extra Trees regressor,
and three techniques for anomaly detection using Deviation &
Seasonal & STL methods, and the project success to predict the
traffic at next 8 hours with MAPE less than 4%.
